Data Visualization

What is the story?
  - Trends - Example: Ice cream sales over time
  - Correlations - Example: Ice cream sales vs. temperature
  - Outliers - Example: Ice cream sales in an unusual region

What kind of data?
  - Quantitative - Data that can be counted or measured; all values are numerical.
  - Discrete - Numerical data that has a finite number of possible values. Example: Number of employees in the office.
  - Continous - Data that is measured and has a value within a range. Example: Rainfall in a year.
  - Categorical - Data that can be sorted according to group or category. Example: Types of products sold.
 
Data Relationships
  - Nominal Comparision - Bar Charts - Example: Number of visitors to various websites.
  - Deviation - This examines how data points relate to each other, particularly how far any given data point differs from the mean. 
                Example: Amusement park tickets sold on a rainy day vs. a regular day.
  - Time Series - This tracks changes in values of a consistent metric over time. Example: Monthly sales
  - Distribution - This shows data distribution, often around a central value. Example: Heights of players on a basketball team.
  - Correlation - This is data with two or more variables that may demonstrate a positive or negative correlation to each other. 
                  Example: Salaries according to education level.
  - Part to Whole - Subset of Data in relation to whole - Example: Percentage of customers purchasing specific products
  - Ranking - This shows how two or more values compare to each other in relative magnitude. 
              Example: Historic weather patterns, ranked from the hottest months to the coldest.
              
   Bar Charts
    - Change over time
      VERTICAL (COLUMN CHART) Best used for chronological data (time-series should always run left to right), or when visualizing negative values below the x-axis
    - Compare different categories
      HORIZONTAL - Best used for data with long category labels.
    - Compare parts of a whole
      Stacked Bar Chart - Best used when there is a need to compare multiple part-to-whole relationships. These can use discrete or continuous data, oriented either vertically or horizontally
      00% STACKED - Best used when the total value of each category is unimportant and percentage distribution of subcategories is the primary message.

    - Bar Chart Best Practices 
        - Use Horizontal Label
        - Space between bar should be 1/2 bar width
        - Start Y axis at 0 - Starting at a value above zero truncates the bars and doesn’t accurately reflect the full value
        - Use Consistent Colors - Use one color for bar charts. You may use an accent color to highlight a significant data point
        - Order Data - Order categories alphabetically, sequentially, or by value
    
  Pie Charts
    - Pie charts are best used for making part-to-whole comparisons with discrete or continuous data. 
      They are most impactful with a small data set
    - Best Practices
      - Visualize no more than 5 charts - It is difficult to differentiate between small values; depicting too many slices decreases the impact of the visualization. 
        If needed, you can group smaller values into an “other” or “miscellaneous” category, but make sure it does not hide interesting or significant information
