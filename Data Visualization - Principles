What is the story?
  - Trends - Example: Ice cream sales over time
  - Correlations - Example: Ice cream sales vs. temperature
  - Outliers - Example: Ice cream sales in an unusual region

What kind of data?
  - Quantitative - Data that can be counted or measured; all values are numerical.
  - Discrete - Numerical data that has a finite number of possible values. Example: Number of employees in the office.
  - Continous - Data that is measured and has a value within a range. Example: Rainfall in a year.
  - Categorical - Data that can be sorted according to group or category. Example: Types of products sold.
 
Data Relationships
  - Nominal Comparision - Bar Charts - Example: Number of visitors to various websites.
  - Deviation - This examines how data points relate to each other, particularly how far any given data point differs from the mean. 
                Example: Amusement park tickets sold on a rainy day vs. a regular day.
  - Time Series - This tracks changes in values of a consistent metric over time. Example: Monthly sales
  - Distribution - This shows data distribution, often around a central value. Example: Heights of players on a basketball team.
  - Correlation - This is data with two or more variables that may demonstrate a positive or negative correlation to each other. 
                  Example: Salaries according to education level.
  - Part to Whole - Subset of Data in relation to whole - Example: Percentage of customers purchasing specific products
  - Ranking - This shows how two or more values compare to each other in relative magnitude. 
              Example: Historic weather patterns, ranked from the hottest months to the coldest.
              
   Bar Charts
    - Change over time
      VERTICAL (COLUMN CHART) Best used for chronological data (time-series should always run left to right), or when visualizing negative values below the x-axis
    - Compare different categories
      HORIZONTAL - Best used for data with long category labels.
    - Compare parts of a whole
      Stacked Bar Chart - Best used when there is a need to compare multiple part-to-whole relationships. These can use discrete or continuous data, oriented either vertically or horizontally
      00% STACKED - Best used when the total value of each category is unimportant and percentage distribution of subcategories is the primary message.

    - Bar Chart Best Practices 
        - Use Horizontal Label
        - Space between bar should be 1/2 bar width
        - Start Y axis at 0 - Starting at a value above zero truncates the bars and doesn’t accurately reflect the full value
        - Use Consistent Colors - Use one color for bar charts. You may use an accent color to highlight a significant data point
        - Order Data - Order categories alphabetically, sequentially, or by value
    
  Pie Charts
    - Pie charts are best used for making part-to-whole comparisons with discrete or continuous data. 
      They are most impactful with a small data set
    - Best Practices
      - Visualize no more than 5 charts - It is difficult to differentiate between small values; depicting too many slices decreases the impact of the visualization. 
        If needed, you can group smaller values into an “other” or “miscellaneous” category, but make sure it does not hide interesting or significant information
      - Do not use multiple pie charts for comparision - Slice sizes are very difficult to compare side-by-side. Use a stacked bar chart instead
      - Verify that values total 100% and that pie slices are sized proportionate to their corresponding value.
      -  Order Slices correctly
        - OPTION 1 - Place the largest section at 12 o’clock, going clockwise. Place the second largest section at 12 o’clock,
                     going counterclockwise. The remaining sections can be placed below, continuing counterclockwise.
        - OPTION 2 - Start the largest section at 12 o’clock, going clockwise. Place remaining sections in descending order, going clockwise
        
Line Charts
  - Line charts are used to show time-series relationships with continuous data. They help show trend, acceleration, deceleration, and volatility.
  - Include zero baseline if possible -Although a line chart does not have to start at a zero baseline, it should be included if possible. If relatively small fluctuations in data are meaningful (e.g., in stock market data), you may truncate the scale to showcase these variances.
  - Do not plot more than 4 lines - If you need to display more, break them out into separate charts for better comparison.
  - Use solid lines - Dashed and dotted lines can be distracting.
  - Label the lines directly - This lets readers quickly identify lines and corresponding labels instead of referencing a legend.
  - Use the right height - Plot all data points so that the line chart takes up approximately two-thirds of the y-axis’ total scale.


Area Charts 
  - depict a time-series relationship, but they are different than line charts in that they can represent volume.
  - Best used to show or compare a quantitative progression over time.
  - STACKED AREA - Best used to visualize part-to-whole relationships, helping show how each category contributes to the cumulative total.
  - 100% STACKED AREA - Best used to show distribution of categories as part of a whole, where the cumulative total is unimportant.
  
  - Best Practices
    - In stacked area charts, arrange data to position categories with highly variable data on the top of the chart and low variability on the bottom
    - START Y-AXIS VALUE AT 0 - Starting the axis above zero truncates the visualization of values.
    - DON’T DISPLAY MORE THAN 4 DATA CATEGORIES - Too many will result in a cluttered visual that is difficult to decipher.
    - USE TRANSPARENT COLORS - In standard area charts, ensure data isn’t obscured in the background by ordering thoughtfully and using transparency.
    - DON’T USE AREA CHARTS TO DISPLAY DISCRETE DATA - The connected lines imply intermediate values, which only exist with continuous data
    
Scatter Plot
  - Scatter plots show the relationship between items based on two sets of variables. They are best used to show correlation in a large amount of data
    For example - Product Data scatter over two metrics - # of Units Sold and Revenue 
                - Alert Category over two metrics - # of Alerts and Time taken to Resolve
  - Best Practices
    - START Y-AXIS VALUE AT 0 - Starting the axis above zero truncates the visualization of values.
    - INCLUDE MORE VARIABLES - Use size and dot color to encode additional data variables.
    - USE TREND LINES - These help draw correlation between the variables to show trends.
    - DON’T COMPARE MORE THAN 2 TREND LINES - Too many lines make data difficult to interpret.
